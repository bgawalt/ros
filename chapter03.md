# Chapter 3: Some basic methods in mathematics and probability

Three motivations for the chapter:

1. Learn building blocks that can be used to construct "elaborate models"
2. Understand generic/abstract inference without looking at details of any
    particular model
3. Construct quick estimates for "small parts of problems -- before fitting a
    more elaborate model."

I do like (3); one failure mode I see a lot in ML work is people prematurely
reaching for expensive and finnicky and elaborate models, before attempting
simpler baselines.
