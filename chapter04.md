# Chapter 4: Statistical inference

[(Return to README)](./README.md)

Spiciest part of the intro paragraph is that the book will be introducing "the
theme of uncertainty in statistical inference and discuss how it is a mistake to
use hypothesis tests or statistical significance to attribute certainty from
noisy data."


## Subsection rundown

### 4.1, Sampling distributions and generative models

#### Sampling, measurement error, and model error

That's the three ways to think about what inference is about:

*  **Sampling:** estimating some characteristics of a population (mean, std. dev
    of height of US women) from a subset of that population
*  **Measurement error:** estimating an underlying pattern, like linear
    regression coefficients, from noisy data.  Note: could be non-additive
    noise (e.g., multiplicative noise); could be discrete data.
*  **Model error:** "All models are wrong, some are useful," so we need
    techniques to characterize the wrongness of your models.
