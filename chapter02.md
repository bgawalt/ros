# Chapter 2: Data and measurement

The book is about fitting lines to data, and moving from there to prediction
and causal inference.  *This* chapter, though, is about "understanding where
your numbers are coming from."  Understanding by making graphs and charts.

## Subsection rundown

### 2.1 Examining where data come from

The Human Development Index is criticized as "pretty much a map of state income
with a mysterious transformation and a catchy name."  The point of the exercise
is to point directions to explore how it *isn't* just a recapitulation of state
income. "Income vs. GDP, maybe something there?"

Re: the partisanship vs. ideology example of Figure 2.3, "even very similar
measures can answer quite different questions."  (In 2008, income predicted
partisanship much better than it did ideology, among self reports of each.)

Not accounting for those "quite different questions" means your conclusions
reached from a regression analysis can lack validity.
