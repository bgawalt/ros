# Notes on "Regression and Other Stories"

I organized a reading group for
["Regression and Other Stories"](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/) a
statistics textbook by Andrew Gelman, Jennifer Hill, and Aki Vehtari. This repo
contains my notes on the reading, chapter by chapter, as well as any demo
scripts I wrote to explore the material.

The book is built around the programming language R, but I will be using Python
throughout, esp. Jupyter notebooks.
